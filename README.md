# Open-TX-Portal-Voice-Pack
This repository contains a COMPLETE Portal voice pack for Open TX software. This pack was specifically made to work with the Taranis QX7, but should also be compatible with other transmitters running OpenTX. This voice pack uses GLADoS as a base voice, and also features many quotes from different game characters.
